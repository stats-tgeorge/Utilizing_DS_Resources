# About Cornell College

- Small liberal arts college of about 1000 students
- One-Course-at-A-Time block schedule 
 - Each class occurs over 3.5 weeks including 18 days of 4 hours of instructional time and three weekends
- **New majors in Applied Statistics and Data Science**

---

# Utilized Resources

- [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/index.html) by Mine `r Citet(Bib,"Cetinkaya-Rundel")`
- Data science ethics assignments from the [Quantitative Analysis Institute](https://sites.google.com/wellesley.edu/qai-online-resources/home) at Wellesley College `r Cite(Bib,"Pattanayak")`
- Workshops by Julia Silge available at [https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext-tutorial/site/](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext-tutorial/site/)
- Many R packages were use throughout the class but [ghclass](https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/) was particularly useful for teaching/running the course

## Learning the Bare Necessities
I was new to Git, Github, RStudio Server (Linux), and a handful of the tidyverse packages and functions. 

- What did I **need** to learn to teach this class in this way?
 - Basic Git functions such as push,pulling, and handling git merge conflicts in RStudio
 - *ghclass* R package made using Git/Github easier. See my course materials.
 - Some new packages and functions in the *tidyverse* such as *forcats*
- What are some extra things I learned? 
 - RStudio server implementation and management in Ubuntu (Linux) [Use Examples](https://github.com/stats-tgeorge/Utilizing_DS_Resources/blob/main/course-materials/Cluster%20Info%20and%20Commands.docx) 
 - Learning the Xaringan R package to modify slides

# Future Updates
- Expanding the ethics integration in the course
- Trying out the new [gradetools](https://github.com/federicazoe/gradetools) R package
- Less statistical inference and more data wrangling
- Higher project and assessment expectations.
- Github actions
- Quarto
