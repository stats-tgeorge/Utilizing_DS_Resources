# About Cornell College

- Small liberal arts college of about 1000 students
- One-Course-at-A-Time block schedule 
 - Each class occurs over 3.5 weeks including 18 days of 4 hours of instructional time and three weekends
- **New majors in Applied Statistics and Data Science**

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Course Objectives -->
<!-- - From the syllabus "respect, explore, understand, and utilize data in a way that is reproducible using version control." -->
<!-- - Data wrangling -->
<!-- - Utilizing version control & good organization to facilitate reproducible work -->
<!-- - Building technical skills in R, and RStudio, namely *tidyverse* functions -->
<!-- - Understanding and learning to consider ethical problems in data science -->
<!-- - Creating understandable and honest data visualizations -->
<!-- - Communicating statistical analysis -->

# Utilized Resources

- [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/index.html) by Mine `r Citet(Bib,"Cetinkaya-Rundel")`
- Data science ethics assignments from the [Quantitative Analysis Institute](https://sites.google.com/wellesley.edu/qai-online-resources/home) at Wellesley College `r Cite(Bib,"Pattanayak")`
- Workshops by Julia Silge available at [https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext-tutorial/site/](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext-tutorial/site/)
- Many R packages were use throughout the class but [ghclass](https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/) was particularly useful for teaching/running the course

# A Day in the Class
.pull-left[
- This course has a pre-requisite of *either* introductory statistics or computer science (python)
- Each day consists of 2, 2 hour sessions

Student homeworks:
 - R homework similar to labs
 - Readings related to ethics
 - Group project

<!-- # Technologies -->
<!-- - Learning Management System (LMS) - Moodle -->
<!-- - [RStudio Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/) (new implementation for this course, see `r Citet(Bib,"Cetinkaya-Rundel2018")` for a discussion on infrastructure)  -->
<!--  - A combination of [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and R scripts were used -->
<!-- - Git and Github.  -->
<!--  - Students used Git through the RStudio panel within an R project -->
<!--  - I also used Github desktop application for some convenience such as pulling one students current work to help them -->
<!-- - R packages - primarily within the *tidyverse*  -->
<!--  - [*ghclass*](https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/)  for distributing and collecting repositories `r Cite(Bib,"Rundel")`. -->

# Teaching Pedagogies

# Learning the Bare Necessities
- I was new to Git, Github, RStudio Server (Linux), and a handful of the tidyverse packages and functions
- What did I *need* to learn to teach this class in this way?
 - Git and Github: Basic Git functions such as push,pulling, and handling git merge conflicts in RStudio
 - *ghclass* R package made using Git/Github for distributing content much smoother. See the [R script I created](https://github.com/stats-tgeorge/Utilizing_DS_Resources/tree/main/course-materials/ghclass-scripts)

All course materials can be found at [bit.ly/3Qq99Qb](https://bit.ly/3Qq99Qb)

# Learning more than needed
 - RStudio server implementation and management required learning some basic Linux commands. See the [short list of commands I ended up needing](https://github.com/stats-tgeorge/Utilizing_DS_Resources/blob/main/course-materials/Cluster%20Info%20and%20Commands.docx) 
 - Learning the Xaringan R package to modify slides (now I'm using it for this!)
  - I converted the notes to pdf's using *xaringanBuilder* package. See my [short script](https://github.com/stats-tgeorge/Utilizing_DS_Resources/blob/main/course-materials/Notes/convertnotestopdf.R). *I will host these using Github pages next time.*

# Student Comments
- "I enjoy working with my group on the project, although it did take countless hours outside of the classroom I enjoyed it a lot and felt accomplished after presenting."

-   "Working on labs and application exercises were beneficial for me. After completing those I could refer back to them which helped a lot. When working alone I often would get stuck on a exercise but when working in groups we were able to put our heads together and solve the problems. I really enjoyed that."

- "There were far too many notes in this class."

- "Going over the notes are necessary but I thought the length of the slides were way too long. It was hard to stay engaged the whole time when going
over the notes because I was not using the code in r I was just seeing the results on the powerpoint. I think the notes could be trimmed down some
to free up more space for application exercises."

# Future Updates
- Expanding the ethics integration in the course
 - I am working with a Cornell College faculty, Dr. Megan Altman, to integrate CARVE(R) principals into the data science discussions
 - [integrated ethics LABS](https://integratedethicslabs.org/labs-overview/)
 - Using some modules from `r Citep(Bib,"Beckman2022")`
- Trying out [gradetools](https://github.com/federicazoe/gradetools) to make grading quick while giving useful feedback to students `r Cite(Bib,"Federica")`
- Less statistical inference and more data wrangling
- Higher project expectations
- Github actions to help students know if they submitted something that others can compile (reproducible)
- Rethinking of exams. The estimated time required was way off.
- Quarto
