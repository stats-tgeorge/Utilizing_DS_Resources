## Data science


.pull-left-wide[
- Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. 

- We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics $\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

**Q: Why not language X?**  
A: We can discuss that over `r emo::ji("coffee")`.

Google Trend Index: 
- Numerical summary of popularity of search words on Google. 
- Travel index, 2012 - 2017 and united states
- Any interesting features?

- This a "snippet" of our data
- We have the exact data that each index was recorded
- Possibly what we want is to just aggregate by season and eliminating the seasonal affect to see the larger time span trend

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="left"}

This becomes a cycle - the communication/goals will often lead to changes in your model.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="left"}

To make this all happen: we need to program!

We want to go from left to right!

We then used something called "filter" and it our graph only shows data in the three countries we saw
