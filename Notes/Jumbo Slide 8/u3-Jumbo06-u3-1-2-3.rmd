## Original study

Moore, Steven C., et al. **["Association of leisure-time physical activity with risk of 26 types of cancer in 1.44 million adults."](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2521826)** JAMA internal medicine 176.6 (2016): 816-825.

- **Volunteers** were **asked** about their physical activity level over the preceding year. 
- Half exercised less than about 150 minutes per week, half exercised more. 
- Compared to the bottom 10% of exercisers, the top 10% had lower rates of esophageal, liver, lung, endometrial, colon, and breast cancer.
- Researchers found no association between exercising and 13 other cancers (e.g. pancreatic, ovarian, and brain).

## OK Cupid data breach

- In 2016, researchers published data of 70,000 OkCupid users—including usernames, political leanings, drug usage, and intimate sexual details

- Researchers didn't release the real names and pictures of OKCupid users, but their identities could easily be uncovered from the details provided, e.g. usernames

## Amazon's experimental hiring algorithm

- Used AI to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars -- much like shoppers rate products on Amazon
- Amazon's system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way; it taught itself that male candidates were preferable

.pull-left-wide[
>Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models’ judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said.

## ProPublica analysis

### **Data:**

Risk scores assigned to more than 7,000 people arrested in Broward County, Florida, in 2013 and 2014 + whether they were charged with new crimes over the next two years

---

## ProPublica analysis

### **Results:**

- 20% of those predicted to commit violent crimes actually did
- Algorithm had higher accuracy (61%) when full range of crimes taken into account (e.g. misdemeanors)
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/propublica-results.png")
```
- Algorithm was more likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, at almost twice the rate as white defendants
- White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants

## Parting thoughts

- At some point during your data science learning journey you will learn tools that can be used unethically
- You might also be tempted to use your knowledge in a way that is ethically questionable either because of business goals or for the pursuit of further knowledge (or because your boss told you to do so)

.question[
How do you train yourself to make the right decisions (or reduce the likelihood of accidentally making the wrong decisions) at those points?
