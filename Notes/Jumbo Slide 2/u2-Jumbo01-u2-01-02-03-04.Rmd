- [The Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man, and there must be two women named characters.
- Go to our RStudio Server and start `AE 02 - Bechdel + R Markdown`. You will need to start an R project from the repository.
- Open and knit the R Markdown document `bechdel.Rmd`, review the document, and fill in the blanks.

# What is in a dataset?

---

## Dataset terminology

- Each row is an **observation**
- Each column is a **variable**

.small[

```{r message=FALSE}
starwars
```

]

---

## Luke Skywalker

![luke-skywalker](img/luke-skywalker.png)

---

## What's in the Star Wars data?

Take a `glimpse` at the data:

```{r}
glimpse(starwars)
```

---

.question[
How many rows and columns does this dataset have?
What does each row represent?
What does each column represent?
]

```{r eval = FALSE}
?starwars
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/starwars-help.png")

.question[
How many rows and columns does this dataset have?

# Exploratory data analysis

---

## What is EDA?

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analysing data sets to summarize its main characteristics
- Often, this is visual -- this is what we'll focus on first
- But we might also calculate summary statistics and perform data wrangling/manipulation/transformation at (or before) this stage of the analysis -- this is what we'll focus on next

---

## Mass vs. height

.question[ 
How would you describe the relationship between mass and height of Starwars characters?
What other variables would help us understand data points that don't follow the overall trend?
Who is the not so tall but really chubby character?
]

```{r fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)") +
  geom_point(data = starwars %>% filter(name == "Jabba Desilijic Tiure"), size = 5, pch = 1, color = "pink", stroke = 3)
```

---

## Jabba!

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE, out.width = "80%"}
jabba <- image_read("img/jabba.png")

fig <- image_graph(width = 1600, height = 900, res = 200)

# Data visualization

## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device." --- John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data
- Many tools for visualizing data -- R is one of them
- Many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations -- **ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use

## Hello ggplot2!

.pull-left-wide[
- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

- The ggplot2 package comes with the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

**Mapping**

```{r warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,

**Setting**

```{r warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

           y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) #<<
```
]

---

## Mapping vs. setting

- **Mapping:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points based on the values of a variable in the data
  - goes into `aes()`

- **Setting:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points **not** based on the values of a variable in the data
  - goes into `geom_*()` (this was `geom_point()` in the previous example, but we'll learn about other geoms soon!)

# Faceting

## Faceting

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data
- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label = "facet", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
```
]

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ island) #<<
```
]
]

## Various ways to facet

.question[
In the next few slides describe what each plot displays. Think about how the code relates to the output.

**Note:** The plots in the next few slides do not have proper titles, axis labels, etc. because we want you to figure out what's happening in the plots.
But you should always label your plots!

## Faceting summary

- `facet_grid()`:
    - 2d grid
    - `rows ~ cols`
    - use `.` for no split
- `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped according to number of rows and columns specified or available plotting area

# Terminology

---

## Number of variables involved

- Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable
- Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables
- Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

---

## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

- Not all loans are created equal -- ease of getting a loan depends on (apparent) ability to pay back the loan

## Describing shapes of numerical distributions

- shape:
    - skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    - modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
- center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
- spread: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
- unusual observations
