# About Cornell College

- Small liberal arts college of about 1000 students
- One-Course-at-A-Time block schedule 
 - Each class occurs over 3.5 weeks including 18 days of 4 hours of instructional time and three weekends
- New majors in Applied Statistics and Data Science

---

# Course Objectives
- From the syllabus "respect, explore, understand, and utilize data in a way that is reproducible using version control."
 - Data wrangling
 - Utilizing version control + good organization to create reproducible work
 - Building technical kills in R, and RStudio, namely *tidyverse* functions
 - Understanding and learning to consider ethical problems in data science
 - Creating understandable and honest data visualizations
 - Communicating statistical analysis

---

# Utilized Resources

- [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/index.html) by Mine Chetinkaya-Rundel
- [Quantitative Analysis Institute](https://sites.google.com/wellesley.edu/qai-online-resources/home) at Wellesley College including work by Casey Pattanayak, Donna Gan, Tersa Li, Kat Liang, and Kily Wong
- Workshops by Julia Silge available at [https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext-tutorial/site/](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext-tutorial/site/)
- Many R packages used in code but [ghclass](https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/) was particularly useful for teaching/running the course
---

# My Classroom
- Only 15 students
- This course has a pre-requisite of *either* introductory statistics or introductory computer science (python) (almost all of these students had taken both). 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Classroom_Layout.png")
```

---

# A Day in the Class
- Each day consists of 2, 2 hour sessions.
- Typical class flow:
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/DailyFlow.png")
```

- After class each day they completed 1 homework, read 1-3 chapters of content from sources such as [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) or ethics realated materials discussed later

# Course Schedule
```{r schedule,echo=F}
sch <- read.csv('DSC_223_Course_Schedule.csv',header =F) 
  sch %>% slice(1:9) %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Day","Topics Covered"))%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 20)%>%
  footnote('In reference to Data Science in a Box with S = Slides, AE = Application Exercises, L = Labs')

```

# Course Schedule
```{r schedule2,echo=F}
  sch %>% slice(10:18) %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Day","Topics Covered"))%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 20)%>%
  footnote('In reference to Data Science in a Box with S = Slides, AE = Application Exercises, L = Labs')

```

# Data Science Ethics
- Data Science in  Box offers a collection of videos of speakers discussing topics such as algorithm bias and miss-leading visualizations
- This was used in combination to the ethics assignments at [Quantitative Analysis Institute](https://sites.google.com/wellesley.edu/qai-online-resources/home) [@Pattanayak]
- A more thorough approach will be used in the future. Such as adding modules from [@Beckman2022]

---

# Technologies
- Learning Management Software Moodle
- RStudio Server
- Git and Github. 
 - Students used Git through the RStudio panel
 - I used Github desktop application too
- R packages - primarily within *tidyverse* 
 - *ghclass* [@Rundel]
 
---

# Teaching Pedagogies
- Collaborative learning
- Group of students would have to work together to solve a few exercises on the lab
 - One student would pull the lab from Github and would be connected to the table TV
 - Other students would have to work with the student with the current version to solve a few problems.
 - That student would then push and the next student would pull the now current version. 
  - This was deviated from for projects and examples to simulate merge conflicts
- Consistent syntax to reduce cognitive load
- Version control to lead to reproducible work 

---

# Learning the Bare Necessities
- I was new to Git, Github, RStudio Server (Linux), and a handful of the tidyverse packages used.
- What did I *need* to learn to teach this class?
 - Basic Git functions such as push,pulling, and handling merge conflicts in RStudio
 - *ghclass* R package made much of the Git/Github learning much smoother
 - RStudio server managment required learning some basic Linux commands. See XXX
 - Learning the Xaringan R package to modify slides (now I'm using it for this!)
 
---

# Future Updates
- Expanding the ethics discussion in the course
 - I will be working with a Cornell College faculty in Philosophy this summer.
- Trying out [gradetools](https://github.com/federicazoe/gradetools) to make grading quick but still giving feedback to students
- Less inference and more data wrangling
- Higher project expectations
