# initial meeting

Put anything you write for the initail meeting in this document. This includes a research question and one paragraph describing your intended project. Your group will also present the data you have found. Together, as a group, we will review your idea and discuss your ideas. Every group member must contribute to this conversation. This also gives me an opportunity to help you decide if the data you have chosen will work for your questions of interest.
