In this mini analysis we work with the data used in the FiveThirtyEight
story titled [“The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion
of
Women”](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/).
Your task is to fill in the blanks denoted by `___`.

## Data and packages

We start with loading the packages we’ll use.

``` r
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)
```

The dataset contains information on 1794 movies released between 1970
and 2013. However we’ll focus our analysis on movies released between
1990 and 2013.

``` r
bechdel90_13 <- bechdel %>% 
  filter(between(year, 1990, 2013))
```

There are `___` such movies.

The financial variables we’ll focus on are the following:

-   `budget_2013`: Budget in 2013 inflation adjusted dollars
-   `domgross_2013`: Domestic gross (US) in 2013 inflation adjusted
    dollars
-   `intgross_2013`: Total International (i.e., worldwide) gross in 2013
    inflation adjusted dollars

And we’ll also use the `binary` and `clean_test` variables for
**grouping**.

## Analysis

Let’s take a look at how median budget and gross vary by whether the
movie passed the Bechdel test, which is stored in the `binary` variable.

``` r
bechdel90_13 %>%
  group_by(binary) %>%
  summarise(med_budget = median(budget_2013),
            med_domgross = median(domgross_2013, na.rm = TRUE),
            med_intgross = median(intgross_2013, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 4
    ##   binary med_budget med_domgross med_intgross
    ##   <chr>       <dbl>        <dbl>        <dbl>
    ## 1 FAIL    48385984.    57318606.    104475669
    ## 2 PASS    31070724     45330446.     80124349

Next, let’s take a look at how median budget and gross vary by a more
detailed indicator of the Bechdel test result. This information is
stored in the `clean_test` variable, which takes on the following
values:

-   `ok` = passes test
-   `dubious`
-   `men` = women only talk about men
-   `notalk` = women don’t talk to each other
-   `nowomen` = fewer than two women

``` r
bechdel90_13 %>%
  #group_by(___) %>%
  summarise(med_budget = median(budget_2013),
            med_domgross = median(domgross_2013, na.rm = TRUE),
            med_intgross = median(intgross_2013, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   med_budget med_domgross med_intgross
    ##        <int>        <dbl>        <dbl>
    ## 1   37878971     52270207     93523336

In order to evaluate how return on investment varies among movies that
pass and fail the Bechdel test, we’ll first create a new variable called
`roi` as the ratio of the gross to budget.

``` r
bechdel90_13 <- bechdel90_13 %>%
  mutate(roi = (intgross_2013 + domgross_2013) / budget_2013)
```

Let’s see which movies have the highest return on investment.

``` r
bechdel90_13 %>%
  arrange(desc(roi)) %>% 
  select(title, roi, year)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,615 x 3
    ##    title                     roi  year
    ##    <chr>                   <dbl> <int>
    ##  1 Paranormal Activity      671.  2007
    ##  2 The Blair Witch Project  648.  1999
    ##  3 El Mariachi              583.  1992
    ##  4 Clerks.                  258.  1994
    ##  5 In the Company of Men    231.  1997
    ##  6 Napoleon Dynamite        227.  2004
    ##  7 Once                     190.  2006
    ##  8 The Devil Inside         155.  2012
    ##  9 Primer                   142.  2004
    ## 10 Fireproof                134.  2008
    ## # ... with 1,605 more rows

Below is a visualization of the return on investment by test result,
however it’s difficult to see the distributions due to a few extreme
observations.

``` r
ggplot(data = bechdel90_13, 
       mapping = aes(x = clean_test, y = roi, color = binary)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Return on investment vs. Bechdel test result",
       x = "Detailed Bechdel result",
       y = "___",
       color = "Binary Bechdel result")
```

What are those movies with *very* high returns on investment?

``` r
bechdel90_13 %>%
  filter(roi > 400) %>%
  select(title, budget_2013, domgross_2013, year)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 4
    ##   title                   budget_2013 domgross_2013  year
    ##   <chr>                         <int>         <dbl> <int>
    ## 1 Paranormal Activity          505595     121251476  2007
    ## 2 The Blair Witch Project      839077     196538593  1999
    ## 3 El Mariachi                   11622       3388636  1992

Zooming in on the movies with `roi < ___` provides a better view of how
the medians across the categories compare:

``` r
ggplot(data = bechdel90_13, mapping = aes(x = clean_test, y = roi, color = binary)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Return on investment vs. Bechdel test result",
       subtitle = "___", # Something about zooming in to a certain level
       x = "Detailed Bechdel result",
       y = "Return on investment",
       color = "Binary Bechdel result") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 15))
```

# Any Conclusions?

We often have goals in mind when exploring data - it may be just to
explore the data! Answer the following questions:

1.  What is the “dubious” group?

2.  Compare the groups. How does the return on investment compare
    between those passing the test and those not? Give a full sentence
    answer.

3.  What problem is this anayliss trying to reveal? Is this plot, on its
    own, biased?

4.  What would you like to see in the data next? Give a full sentence
    answer.

5.  What ideas your group have for making this visualization even
    better? Think about color or formatting changes.

6.  What are the implications of this research in the real world? What
    is the intention of those that complied and retrived the data? Is
    their goal ethical?

7.  Was the data collected in a legal way that protected indivduals
    rights as humans? Does this article give enough information to asses
    this?

8.  Are there any variables that may not be ethical to use? Are we
    prepared to answer such questions?
