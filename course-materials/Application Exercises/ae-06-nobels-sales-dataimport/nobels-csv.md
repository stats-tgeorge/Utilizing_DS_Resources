``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's first load the data:

``` r
nobel <- ___(___)
```

Then let's split the data into two:

``` r
# stem laureates
___ <- nobel %>%
  filter(___)

# non-steam laureates
___ <- nobel %>%
  filter(___)
```

And finally write out the data:

``` r
# add code for writing out the two data frames here
```
