## Load data
Complete the function to read the data in from the data folder.

```{r data-load}

### Answer the following about the day, month, and year you were born in (number format). Change the **eval=F** to T. Do not change the **include**.
```{r sample-data,include = F, eval=F}
d <-__
m <-__
y <- ____

set.seed(d+m+y)

# The data you should be using for the exam:
model_pumpkins <- pumpkins[sample.int(28065,28065,T),]
