## Lab Instructions

Lab 01-16

These contain the instructions for the labs. 

### Special Mentions 

#### Lab 15

Lab 15 Needs a significant amount of work but was created by Tyler George (relies on RStudio’s shiny tutorials). 

#### Lab 16
Lab 16 expands on the text analysis work in Data Science in a Box’s text analysis slides (u5-d01,u5-d02) and adds more from Julia Silge’s workshops [HERE](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext-tutorial/site/). Julia’s work is also the original source for the Data Science a Box text analysis materials. See Julia and David Robinson’s book [Welcome to Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).

This particular lab was actually presented as live coding with both the data science students and 5 students visiting from a digital humanities class on campus. Student groups get to make some decisions along the way (books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)and so everybody has some different results. Each table had at least 1 student connected to the table TV (see [HERE](https://stats-tgeorge.github.io/Utilizing_DS_Resources/slides/poster_slides.html#5) so we could compare and see a variety of analysis around the room. 

### Note

Some of the later labs did not have separate instructions from their starter. The instructions within the starter documenter were sufficient.
